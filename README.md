# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Student Performance Dataset

# Overview
This task explores the *StudentsPerformance* dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights about student scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.

# Steps Performed
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploring structure and data types  
3. Identifying distributions, trends, and correlations  
4. Group comparisons:
   - Gender
   - Test preparation course
   - Parental level of education  
5. Visualization of key insights  

# Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  

# Files in this repo
- Task2_EDA → Full notebook with code and outputs  
- StudentsPerformance.csv → Dataset used  

# Key Insights
- Female students scored higher on Reading & Writing, while males had slightly better Math scores.  
- Students who completed a test preparation course performed significantly better across all subjects.  
- Higher parental education levels correlated with improved student scores.
